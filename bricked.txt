1. When connecting your Eken camera to the PC, always use the USB 2.0 ports AND NOT the USB 3.0 which are not compatible with the 
SPCA6350 drivers. The Eken camera will not be recognised correctly, when viewed with Device Manager.

2. If the Eken camera, "Freezes" OR will not "Power up" after a firmware upgrade, then please do the following :-
Remove the battery for 5 seconds, then re-insert it again, this action will "RESET" the Eken H9 camera. Next push and hold the "Power ON" button at 
the front of the camera, hold it pushed in for at least 8 seconds, the camara should now start working correctly.
This is always recommended, whenever the camera "Freezes" or when it will not "Power up".

Recovery

Instructions are are in my "How to Recover your Bricked H? or H?R camera made SIMPLE.pdf easy to follow PDF Manual. Note ?=2/3/8/9/H8 Plus/H8 Pro/ H8s/ H9 Plus/H9 Pro.

If your camera firmware does not have the BKA/BL/BS/BT/BTA/BTR/EKA/EKEKA/EKR/LY/LYR/MKR/RS/RY/RY-LY/SSR/SY/XKR/XTR lettering, please do not update. It is likely your camera is a clone, and it will brick if you use the improper Eken firmware on it!

All downloadable firmware will be displayed as WEB_XXX, only firmware direct from the EKEN factory will display EK letters and WEB_ and the Factory firmware will have "STD_" in it.
This is to prevent leaking of original EKEN firmware, so all firmware Updates, will be displayed as WEB_XXX versions.

On this page, we are going to try to find out what hardware your Eken H9 camera has installed in it.
